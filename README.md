# 📧 Email Generator - Java Console & GUI Application
       This project is a _Java-based application_ that automatically generates a professional company email address and a secure random password based on user input. It supports both **console-based interaction using Scanner** and a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built using Java Swing.

## 📝 Project Overview
      The Email Generator simulates how companies create official email IDs for their employees. It takes the user's first name, last name, department, and desired password length as input. It then generates:
- A company-style email address
- A random secure password
- Stores alternate email
- Sets mailbox capacity
This application is ideal for understanding **OOP concepts, Java Swing**, and user interaction in both **CLI** and **GUI** modes.

## 🔍 Features
- ✅ Auto-generate email ID based on user details  
- 🔐 Secure password generation (random + custom length)  
- 📨 Alternate email storage  
- 🗃️ Mailbox capacity setup  
- 🖥️ GUI version with text fields, combo box & button actions  
- 🧪 Organized Java classes with encapsulation and modular structure  

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Eclipse
- Java 17  
- Java Swing (for GUI)  
- AWT & Event Handling  
- OOP Concepts (Classes, Encapsulation, Methods, Constructors)
